- BEHAVIOR BUILDER:


    * MAKE TABLE THREAD SAVE (see BB thread for updating!)

    * rebuild table model...
    * mark out mouthing
    * move "time factor" bar somewhere else !!!

    * export: correct agent (from existing...)
        * delete other poses (make optional)
    * save whole thing!
    * adjust timing with timing slider (on beh. seq. level)
    * table spacing
    



- EMBOTS: Frontend
  - display lexicon name
  - reload => also reload in generator

- Keep in mind:
  - a hold gesture cannot be set with stroke_end (alg. doesn't find sync point)
  - double id's cause system to *ignore* prev. gestures!

- LEXICON:
  - principled way of making several scripts into one gesture

- gesture generator:
  - allow two gestures in parallel (diff. hands)
  - allow gesture sequences

- BML: multiple behaviors
- EMBR: blending --> see also emotion generation
- BML: add emotion tags (or: FML?)
- BML: add autonomous behaviors
