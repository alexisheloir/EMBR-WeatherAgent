This file documents the current BML dialect/subset that we currently
support in the EMBOTS framework.


*** [0] BML BLOCK ***

On the top level, everything is bracketed by a BML tag:

<bml id="b1">
 ...
</bml>

Strictly speakind, an identifier is required but we usually skip it.

*** [1] SPEECH ***

Speech for a TTS is formulated thus:

   <speech id="s32">
     <text>
        <sync id="0" /> Welcome, <sync id="1" />  my name is Amber,
        <sync id="2" /> let me  show you the  expressivity <sync id="3" />
        of virtual characters in this demo.
    </text>
   </speech>

Sync points are defined like this:

<sync id="foo25" />

To refer to the sync points in the <speech> tag you use identifiers like

s32:2

*** [2] GESTURE ***

Gestures that are lexicalized look like this:

<gesture id="g1" type="lexicalized" lexeme="cup_2H" stroke_start="s32:2" />

Possible sync point attributes are:

start
ready
stroke_start
stroke
stroke_end
relax
end

*** [3] FACE ***

A facial expression looks like this:

<face id="f1" type="happy" stroke_start="s:0" stroke_end="s:1"/>

Possible types are:

neutral
happy
angry
disgusted
afraid
sad
surprised
sceptical
eyebrows
